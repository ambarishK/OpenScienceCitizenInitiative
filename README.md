# Open Science Citizen Initiative

Project to set up, organize, and govern an [EU Citizen Initiative](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome) about Open Science.

The question would be simple (but to be finalized):

```
The EU must embed the unconditional user rights to use, modify, and redistribute as
part of the Open Science definition.
```

The point: any Open Source, Open Data, Open Standard, or Open Access that does not provide these
three rights explicitly, is not Open Science.

This Initiative does not imply that everything must be Open Science, but it does stress that we
must not call things Open Science when they are not.
