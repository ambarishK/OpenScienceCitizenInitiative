# Open Science Citizen Initiative

Project to set up, organize, and govern an [EU Citizen Initiative](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome) about Open Science.

The question would be simple (but to be finalized):

```
The EU should embed use, modify, and redistribute as unconditional rights of Open Science.
```

The point: any Open Source, Open Data, Open Standard, or Open Access that does not provide these
three rights explicitly, is not Open Science.
